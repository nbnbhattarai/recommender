4,y,n,n,y,y,"found out that Jolly Pirate Donuts near her house in WV was the one shown on that Smoking Gun episode!  Awesome! ^^ is feeling a little subbydub today. has a new baby sister!  Little Baby No-Name! just found an organization called Think Before You Speak that flips out about people saying, ""that's gay,"" claiming that it's offensive.  That's pretty gay, if you ask me.                                                                                     There is now officially a tea-growing Subbydub Ocean, according to *PROPNAME*. has officialy decided that *PROPNAME* is named after *PROPNAME*. is back from the beach a little scraped up and sunburned, but otherwise okay! is in Georgia tomorrow, then to Florida Saturday, and back to Georgia Sunday. s epic wound is starting to heal!  Yay! has only 8 more days to use the government's money.  Anyone want me to go run the water and waste some more of their money?  Got any grudges?   ;) can't remember the name of that agility school in WV and can't find it on the Internet!  Anyone else remember?  Dad or MJ? is in Valdosta tomorrow, then to St. Augustine Saturday, then back to Valdosta Sunday, and back home to Charleston Sunday, too. just scrubbed the inside of the car.  In the dark.  With the mosquitoes. just got back from the pool.  Wow, I'm exhausted... stayed up to finish The Kite Runner last night, probably around four in the morning.  I'm not sure because I don't have a clock up there! lol just finished ""There Are No Children Here.""  It was horrendous. s little sister told her that she could ""ride her tricycle with no handlebars.""  As long as you don't start singing their more political songs, sweetie.  :P just planned the perfect field trip. ^^ spent 1 hour in the car, 2 hours in Potomac Mills, only went to 2 stores, and got just a cup out of the whole day.  WOW. is going to try drawing upstairs.  Didn't work so well in the car.  Usually a change of atmosphere helps. The early bird gets the worm...but the second mouse gets the cheese in the trap.  Words to live by.  I do, at least. just got back from the zoo.  No gray wolves, no girraffes...really not much of anything.  :( s mom can't find a cheap orange Jansport backpack online because *PROPNAME* used one in Twilight, so everyone's paying top-dollar for them.  Hilarious.  :D is having fun learning the 12 Principles of Animation.  Also, I drove on a road for the first time yesterday.  Don't worry; it was just a few blocks, and everyone should be back on their feet in no time.  ;) just told *PROPNAME* died.  There was a short pause.  ""We need a new *PROPNAME*.""  Nice. s hamster died last night. :( Tuition at Rhode Island is 35 grand!! The girl walking me to my classes today asked me if I played any sports.  HAHAHAHA HA ha ha ha...Ahh, that's funny.  Silly cheerleaders. might need to make an easier ""how-well-do-you-know"" quiz.  Go take it and tell me.  ; ) just found out that you lose your sense of smell when you sleep.  Interesting. does NOT like this *PROPNAME* chick!  At all! can't get the freaking pictures on Facebook to work!  I hate that app! >:( just filled out a survey to get monthly email coupons for ProPlan at Complete Petmart!  Awesome!  ^^ thinks maybe that trying to upload a 9.8 meg photo to crappy facebook isn't such a good idea... s mom just said, ""*PROPNAME*'s right!""  LOL! *PROPNAME*'s tantrum has finally come to a close.  Phew!  (Read my note for more details ;) ) thinks that people should learn more about a foreign country's customs and be more polite in said foreign country! s back does not like to tan (or sunburn) evenly!  My back is splotchy again, and this time I didn't even use sunscreen!  >:( had only 5 hours of sleep last night and somehow feels fine, but will have 7-8 hours of sleep on schooldays and cannot seem to wake up in the morning.  What the crap is that?? really thinks there's NO WAY she'll finish that collage by tomorrow.  Seriously. finds it funny how absolutely Kung Fu Panda dominated the *PROPNAME* last year.  Even WALL-E didn't stand a chance!  (Oh, yeah, that's what *PROPNAME* was named after. ;) finally found her tea diffuser!  It's tea time, biyotch!  ...Hmm, am I allowed to say that?  Guess I'll find out when I'm grounded for a week...  ;) s Venus' fly trap caught its first bug: a little gnat.  Aww, they grow up so fast... LOVED the new Family Guy the other night.  Watching the Disney scene was a lot of fun.  On that note, it's all animated in Korea.  What is up with that?  Can't we animate our own shows in our own country?! has a new cell number: (229) 251-4618.  Save it now.  SAVE IT! had a half day today!  Yay! New Bones yesterday, new Soup and Dog Whisperer tonight, and new Simpsons and Family Guy Sunday!  And I've brought my science grade up from an 84 to a 91!  WOOOO! Really needs to plan out the next two days carefully... Hmm...  �_� s mom is playing Scrabble.  Mom: ""What the heck does 'rehem' mean?  Oh, wait; that was my word.""  I think she needs to go lay down like *PROPNAME* for a little while. is alive.  You should try it sometime; it's a lot of fun. jumping on the lyrics-for-status bandwagon: Don't let apathy police the populace, we will march across those stereotypes that were marked for us. The answer's obvious; we switch the consonants and change the ""sword"" to ""words"" and lift continents.  9//11 <3 watched the President's speech yesterday.  Wow, I'm SOOO indoctrinated!  [//sarcasm]  Stupid radical jerks... tiny fingers...can't type...pinky hurts...too many octaves...Why? Why, genetics, why? thinks people should either do something or shut up and deal!  We were the (pretty much) first country to have a peaceful transfer of power between political parties.  Let's go back to those times, shall we?  If you're not gonna do anything about what you don't like, then please, shut up and leave everyone else alone. kthxbi. s weird cat came inside not for a bowl of food, but for a bowl of water.  I poured some water over near where he was outside and he came trotting over straight into my arms!  XD WHAT?  WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THAT ZOMBIELAND WAS FILMED AT WILD ADVENTURES?!  So those guys trying to recruit LHS students for a ""big movie making fun of zombie movies filmed near WA and in the woods"" were actually legit!  OMG I have to go see it! Also, all you people in Valdosta fail for not telling me about it! ;) can't believe how many restaurants and stores didn't have their flags at half-staff today!  How can you possibly forget what today is, especially if the building right next to you has theirs at half-staff?  9//11 <3 New cell number: (555) 555-5555 helps the police, because nice police are nice to me! XD Serving God is doing good to man, but praying is thought an easier service and is therefore more generally chosen. just posted her Amazon Christmas list on here.  Be sure to read the notes at the top!! ""The role of Bruce Wayne//Batman was originally offered to *PROPNAME*, but he turned it down."" WHAT??! would like to remind everybody that we live in a multicultural society composed of more than just Christians, that this country was NOT built off of Christianity (in fact, many of our Founding Fathers were Deists, not Christians) and the only ones keeping Christ out of Christmas are the people who insist on filing lawsuits for not saying ""Christmas"" instead of spending their time caring for others!  Happy Holidays! just got back from camping.  I feel so disgusting... thinks that maybe if more real guys were more like *PROPNAME* from Dragon Age, she might be more willing to date.  Yes, I seriously just said that. *PROPNAME*. ;) thinks *PROPNAME* deserves yet another apology from Warner Brothers.  For multiple reasons.  How do you leave out the big, climactic battle scene of a book?  How does that happen?  And then you turn around and add in an entire scene that not only didn't happen, but also makes no sense whatsoever. is watching the Dog Whisperer where an aggressive Chihuahua rules all the pit bulls at a pit bull rescue! freakin. Loves. Photoshop.  Now if only I could find some classes... doesn't know what to do for some people for Christmas!  D: is frustrated... got her game fixed!  Almost done, now...just a few more rooms, then off to the evil dragon!  I have a feeling something bad's gonna happen.  Just a hunch... just watched a documentary on 9//11 conspiracy theorists.  Those have got to be the most low-down, small-minded, egotistical, self-centered, uncaring, ignorant, heartless monsters I have ever seen. Ugh, nevermind.  Got stuck and had to backtrack.  Might as well do all the side quests while I'm at it.  Maybe I'll finish by freaking Friday... feels pretty confident about the Chemistry test tomorrow. Wow, DA is tossing out achievements like crazy.  Good ones, too.  Also, I cannot type today to save my life.  I can't tell you how many times I had to hit the backspace while typing this. X-l ""The world may end in 2012 but this show won't."" XD LOL! Hmm, that wasn't too bad. Had me worried for a minute.  I've certainly seen worse endings. Like freakin' Fallen! Seriously, what the crap was that?! Anyways, not bad. ^^ Huh. I stand corrected. Why? Why does BioWare have to be so mean to me? I KNOW Mass Effect 2 is out! Leave me alone! DX"

So I have that going for me. day of phone dates with trappers & furbearer biologists... ooh baby! it was hot! it was hot. *PROPNAME*:   This is a deliberate insult against me and my people. *PROPNAME*. *PROPNAME*: Who the fuck are his people?  *PROPNAME*:   I don't know... little scientists, I guess. come on, somebody tell me how everyone's getting these symbols on Fb. this is just too much.  Hey guess what else? 199 pages.  Got-to-crank-out-one-more... is designing a lovely tattoo... yes, I realize I have a stack of papers to grade. Coffee break soon. appreciates this special time of year when you're a misfit if you don't dress & behave like a freak :) the universe is a symphony and the laws of physics are harmonies of a superstring. How beautiful. hmm.. if I were a fly, I'd be dreaming about devil's tongue. Nite, all is about to fall out of her bed, out of her clothes, and into the Niiiiiiiiiight Kitchen. ah, nothing in the world is as beautiful as fresh music. just broke 200 pages :) ""Life is miraculous; even when it's disastrous, it's still incredible. I'm fascinated with everything; life is fascinating. I'm fascinated by trees and dogs, but no one wants to hear me talk about it."" -*PROPNAME* attempting these writing samples, a.k.a., trying to balance on that fine line between  creative nonfiction & academic journal article... tricky business. needs to learn how to be diurnal & studious. when life gives you fall apples, eat them. some painters work with oils, some with acrylics.  *PROPNAME* & I work with dumps. likes windows.

And unlike LOL Catz, I'm not inbred//illiterate.  I am 68% retarded, however, but that's mostly because I drool. is expecting... but doesn't know the bunny daddy. just experienced orthostatic hypotension. trippy. I used to have a boyfriend with a wooden leg, but I broke it off. Ahhhh!! what is this strange white stuff coming from the sky?!

Spook is in the air :) saw several dead rainbows today :( so Season 4 of Dexter started out crrrraaazy! proof that soul-shattering, awe-inspiring things can evolve? Music. is sipping coffee, petting a bunny, listening to music, & dicking around on Fb. How's that for multitasking? I can process chemical, acoustical, tactile, and visual stimuli simultaneously, all while actively avoiding any kind of work AND maintaining homeostasis! shared bodily fluids with 3 people in lab today & didn't get infected ;) I think *PROPNAME* may have attracted a tall chicken & a wolf-girl with her salmon patty trail cam bait. when life gives you shit, grind it up, freeze-dry it, and extract the glucocorticoids. we wanted to say you shouldn't suffer this way. We love you, Tuqqy. growing up is weird. was unexpectedly mesmerized by how beautiful Pennsylvania is today. no thesis project. no hope for the future, other than a miracle. even though yesterday's laborious morning of shoveling would appear to be in vain, I don't have to teach any labs today!

I will never get my Master's or get out of Frostburg :( is in less danger of getting a lump of coal for Christmas every year, as we deplete the earth's fossil fuels. might almost like Bridget's cinnamon, cardamom, & black pepper tea more than coffee! Avatar makes me proud to be a biologist. ""coming up, it's Man Vs. Wild, followed by Frying Human Meat Putting on Spices and Saving it With Maggots at 9:00."" Gotta love Bridget. CABIN FEVER. it's really amazing that a meatball can roll under a bush and eventually grow into a meatball tree. I am the fool; the hierophant crosses me. to think we are who we are largely because of the deactivation of Myosin Heavy Chain 16 (MYH16)... fascinating. in a moment, something poked him in an infuriatingly private place. hmm, can't wait to try out this ""synthetic fermented egg"" lure... hey *PROPNAME*, don't make it bad. Don't eat all the houseplants, chew wires, throw temper tantrums, and break out of your cage.  All you need is love, little man. computer's broken :( worrying about how many important files I may lose. in brighter news, walked my rabbit around the neighborhood on a leash today. the dreams are more fun. road trip with my boy, followed by a play date with a crazy half-Japanese girl & two ferrets. The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious.  It is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science.  Whomever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. -Einstein ravenous black holes, ripples in the space-time continuum, intersex bass taking over US rivers, expectations influencing the wine-tasting experience, the possibility of quantum memory devices... just some of my Science Daily. Truth blows fiction out of the water! last night, I learned that my little boy (*PROPNAME*) loves wine as much as I do; hence, I will no longer be able to set my wine glasses on the ground. hmm... has the mystery of the loud neighborhood farting noise been solved? What's up, Cheese Apple? Your warm, cheesy, buttery, and tart deliciouness? That's what I'm talkin about ;) has a naughty bunny. WOW. All I can say is, I was channeling Deb as I watched that traumatic season finale. suspects that this nightly coffee + Dexter combo isn't the best for her heart. a third of a chicken of a bobcat?  Hmm.. yes, *PROPNAME*. making love to my lollipop, mantis-style. is imagining her feet buried under the cool, wet sand and being sucked toward the ocean. is just an earthbound misfit enjoying a Starbucks double-shot espresso little dee is your hero. spies and other mysterious persons could track me down almost anywhere today, but they only have ~1 hour. rediscovered how fun it is to play in 36 inches of snow :) is gonna get some groovy coyote trail cam pics! you know you're jealous fly in vaseline :( mission for the day: find my car under that 8-ft mound of wintry precipitate. note to self: do not attempt to drive 400 miles in a blizzard ever again. to the air mattress, my noisy nighttime lover. s entire day.. maybe even entire life.. is dependent on who wins this dominance interaction between *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME*. Go *PROPNAME*!!! If *PROPNAME* throws this one, I will surely be in a sour mood for the rest of the week."

Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious Ambiguity. jazz is so pleasant :).... bliss �Men are like a fine wine. They all start out like grapes, and it's our job to stomp on them and keep them in the dark until they mature into something you'd like to have dinner with.�  *PROPNAME* quotes Press on- nothing can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Perseverance and determination alone are omnipotent. *PROPNAME* Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions. Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule. ....Que no te falte capacidad, para discernir el mas aca, del confuso mas alla, que es realidad aparte.....  --(bunbury) I, not events, have the power to make me happy or unhappy today. I can choose which it shall be. Yesterday is dead, tomorrow hasn't arrived yet. I have just one day, today, and I'm going to be happy in it. -----Grouch Marx Morality, like art, means drawing a line someplace. ---Oscar Wilde Everything is fine until it isn�t.

Everything seems to be taking a quick swing at me too -- never taking up residence (knock on wood), but slowly trying to knock me out with a few quick jabs and sucker punches."

Going home to South Florida tomorrow! Been over 6 months :) spending her Saturday night home watching movies with Hot Cocoa. Yum! has only 3 more days left before she gives her life away for *PROPNAME*'s Market Week...sigh..lol has one extra day then she expected and begins her hardcore assignment Sunday, not Saturday. One day of extra rest never hurt anyone :) - smile and the whole world smiles with you. - motivation, not desperation will get you what you want. - the only way to go is up. - family is always there for you, and having even a handful of reliable friends makes life even better :) clocked in 14 hours today. Smiled at *PROPNAME* like a moron as she walked by...umm how was I to know what she looked like? At least I know who she is. Fashion is hard. Models are very nice though. Til next Tuesday... wants to be like *PROPNAME* and do a monologue of all her thoughts and feelings. If only the audience were up to it. Hmmm... had a better day than yesterday.

Live life to the fullest :) is going to see The Lovely Bones, cause it is already out in NYC..yay! is still thinking about how amazing the season finale of Dexter was...wow. And is now hooked on Lost...she gets it now. Still agonizing over seeing Boone go bye bye...sexy sexy man needs a love song that speaks of boots that take your breath away, or the sadness inside you feel when a beautiful piece of clothing costs more than a teeth cleaning. No more of this stuff about wishing a guy//girl would love you. How about wishing you had a place to wear a $3,000 gown? Could afford a $3,000 gown? :) is sharing the secrets of the best products she has used lately. The InStyler- amazing hair, even with light mist outdoors. Urban Decay Primer Potion- I rub my eyes a lot and it still stays (wish it worked for mascara). Forever Makeup Aqua Eyes- gorgeous colors you will get tons of compliments, and it stays!

Hmmm....life it changes is lost, but in 2010 hopefully she will find her way and is making a promise to put herself first :) ugh that *PROPNAME* has the face of a nightmare...ewww wants to be like the cute old couple on third avenue who sit outside, rain or shine, together happily watching people walk by... has been a negative person this week, and although the week is not up yet she will turn it around. Looking for hope to ward off the restlessness black wants to pose a question...if you could go back to several times in your life you wish you could do differently would you? is happy things are coming together for her job and self-wise...is a lot busier than she realized...feels good about keeping her resolution to be selfish to herself...and is letting other people make the effort, and it is great :) is sleepy, loves *PROPNAME*'s new blog, *PROPNAME*'s remodeled blog, *PROPNAME*'s new makeup, and is so pumped for New Moon!!! Did she mention she has the new CD and loves it? used to like facebook more, but it just is not the same...maybe it is time to change things up... is fulfilled in life! Is sooooo excited for everything! :) is sleepy, is sooo happy and content, is so lucky to have the many wonderful people she has in her life, and is really happy to have the opportunity to have work in such a crazy economy :) has a bump on her head she has no idea where it came from, loves the cold weather, feels like a weight has been lifted from her, and is confident in her choices here on out."

To CTYers past and present, I urge you to do two things: 1) Dust off your Garden State soundtrack, there was a reason we listened to it non-stop for 42 days. 2) Mark July 16-18 in your calendar - we are all descending on the land of milk and honey.

47,y,y,n,n,y,"Thanks for all the mazal tovs // congratulations.  :-) *PROPNAME* and I are engaged!  :-)  I'm so happy. ""This is the day, come what may I'll still be saying this is the day."" Loving camp!  :-) Two more weeks left of camp.  Looking forward to seeing *PROPNAME* on the Roof on Sunday, August 9th! Thank goodness my voice is back.  :-)  Shabbat Shalom everyone! I've officially booked an October flight to New York to visit my future husband.  :-) Lesson planning and creating a calendar for the school year... hard to believe I will be teaching already on Sunday. No one should die because they cannot afford health care, and no one should go broke because they get sick. No one should be unable to change jobs because of a ""pre-existing condition."" If you agree, please post this as your status for the rest of the day. Shabbat Shalom! I hate the fact that I currently have no computer.  It is not fun to have to borrow other people's computers. I am thankful for webcams.  It is nice to be able to see my fiance online while he is in New York.  :-) I'm liking my new desktop computer and thankful that it is not giving me any grief thus far.  :-) Shanah Tovah (Happy Jewish New Year)! To all my Jewish friends: Gemar chatimah tovah.- May your final sealing (in the Book of Life) be good. Enjoyed spending the weekend with my love.  Now it is back to the grind. is hoping that everyone who fasted for Yom Kippur had an easy fast and a meaningful prayer experience. Can't wait until Friday morning when I'll be in my fiance's arms.  :-) Contemplating the Forms and Plato's utopian society as I write my paper on Plato.  Please note that I do not actually agree with Plato's ideas, but I find them fascinating. I am getting less and less sleep due to midterms.  :-( I'm so excited about my upcoming trip to New York!  :-)  I leave Thursday night on a red eye. Please put this on your status if you know someone (or are related to someone) who is gay. My wish for 2010 is that people will understand that being gay is not a disease: people who are gay are not looking for a cure but for ACCEPTANCE. I see the light at the end of the tunnel!  Liturgy take home final due Friday and last but not least, Philosophy of Education paper to complete during Winter Break. I hate having laryngitis as a songleader.  I want to be able to do my job, but I can't.  :-( Now that *PROPNAME* has returned to New York, I am finally working on completing my philosophy of Jewish education paper.  It is pleasant to do school work after two weeks of rest, relaxation, and fun.  :-)"

Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now! is annoyed that GM decided it would be cool to have some stupid ass bracket for wiper blades on the G6 resulting in me having to pay $70 for replacement blades. had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:) The first 2 Atlantic tropical storms, *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*, have formed. I'm not too worried but have to admit there's a little unease about the idea of something making it here. Afterall, this is my first rodeo! *PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!! had a great day with a wonderful friend and a wonderful evening with a great boyfriend. I'm one lucky girl:) Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f**k was going on when I first saw it. is nervous about getting cavities filled for the first time ever tomorrow:( The up side is that it probably isn't as bad as repair work from stepping on a shovel;) There I feel a bit better now! is excited about dinner and movie date night:) How many times is it appropriate to say ""What?"" before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said? *PROPNAME* brought me breakfast in bed this morning, hanging out with *PROPNAME* later, then a delicious pineapple pork chop dinner made by *PROPNAME* and watching a movie..what a great day it's going to be!:D If *PROPNAME* San Diego and *PROPNAME* ever got together, their offspring would probably just be completely invisible. is trying to decide what to stock the fridge with so there is a chance that *PROPNAME* will eat something besides fast food for 5 days that I'm gone! :) is a huge nerd and posting books on paperback swap:) Bad news: Novocaine is wearing off so my mouth is hurting a bit now. Good news: I can now drink my pumpkin spice latte without dribbling:) is glad that we waited to watch Wolverine as a rental. is wondering how many people get themselves screwed out of money by not paying attention and keeping records of stuff. I just added another $70 to my ""um no dumby actually I don't owe you that money"" total. Yay me:) I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes.

Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool. Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:) perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :) Happy Halloween! Almost timet to make some snacks for the party tonight:) Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:) shooting and punching some stuff in Borderlands:) just heard a commercial on the radio about some pill to lower cholesterol. They actually said ""Do you have high cholesterol due to poor diet or lack of exercise? Then you need to try this""  No, actually you need to try improving your diet and exercising a bit first.  Just a crazy thought I had... is happy that my new hard drive is installed.

It's going to be even better than usual 'cause we finally have some fall weather here! just saw a commercial for Rihanna's 20//20 interview about her ordeal with *PROPNAME*...isn't it convenient that she is finally able to talk about it in an interview aired the day after her new album comes out? is watching ""The Proposal"". *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*...even if the movie is crap it won't be a total waste:) is excited about my helicopter shaped cookie cutter:) mmm peppermint mocha coffee creamer:) doing some online Christmas shopping doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Californication"" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other ""Dysfunctional family dramas""  This includes ""Dexter"" and ""Rescue Me"" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well. is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;) wasn't very impressed with ""Taking of Pelham 123"" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.

I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays! was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*! is taking *PROPNAME* to the vet for her annual check-up. I know it's good for her I just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much :( Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it! did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house. Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot.

I hope it's good! can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo! why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved. set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken! was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid Saints remixes came on the radio. I'm all for that kind of thing when I actually go to games, but I'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio. A bit mean...but damn funny Sarchasm : The gulf between the author of  sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it. is watching a movie:) just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories. Now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right? Kidding:) accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone! The feminine version of the name *PROPNAME* meaning ""the woman."" Basically never printed on magnets, mugs or other souvenir paraphernalia.

I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames! thinks it might be time for a nap:) is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:( doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:) starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later is home from the Lockport Mardi Gras parade and is ready for a nap! really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me. wonders how sick Bon Jovi is of singing this song"

Dear Online Dictionary Makers, Let people search the text of the entries, not just the entry words.  Make your dictionaries more like a human brain.

I thought these things always just happened... feels weird being in the library during Finals Week as a patron...

They're the best. is starting to wonder whether his eyes reflect light in the near-infrared spectrum or something that's just out of sight for humans but visible to cameras, cuz man, if I only had photos to go by I would swear my eyes are red. And now all I have to do is pack!  Hooray!  One quarter down, two to go! is filling his diaries with references to dinosaurs and Bigfoot.  This way, when the world ends and future historians have only my diary for primary sources, they'll think that at least the world was awesome before it ended.

Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. This should be interesting... wants to get out of Hyde Park. wants to be the very best!  Like no one ever was! A bit of Christmas cuteness: http:////www.watchanimeon.com//axis-powers-hetalia-ii-episode-28// should just become a chef. wonders whether love can bloom, even on a battlefield. Merry Christmas, everyone! Well crap.  My computer's software is currently corrupted or something and won't work.  Right before my two Hell Weeks begin.  Wheeee...

Geez 18th Century Britons, if you love *PROPNAME* the Great so much, why don't you just marry him? Holy crap!  Hiero II of Syracuse was a former general of Pyrrhus of Epirus!  I never knew that!  Hiero has the official title of Awesomest Friendhaver in the Ancient World now, so far as I'm concerned.  Pyrrhus and Archimedes, at least!  Go Hiero!  You're MY hero! Can't wait for next weekend, even if he is getting evaluated! You can ask me one question (Send it to my inbox). Any question- anything. No matter how awkward it can be I'll answer it honestly, no catch. But, I dare you to put this as your status and see what people ask you.  (I can't resist dares...) Off to the art museum!  Sorry Proposal, I'll work on you later...probably... Whutta whutta whutta whutta... wishes a Happy Valentine's Day to all those for whom he cares!

I'm really excited. :) 5 days! is a little upset about the amount of snow, and hopes she gets enough birthday money to visit her parents this weekend. Well, Reedsburg certainly has an interesting way of plowing the streets..... 2 more days. feels 8 months pregnant.... but really I'm only 5 1//2..... wonders if its just coincidence that mine and my best friend's birthdays are EXACTLY twoo weeks apart. Classes start 1//26 at 1:30 pm. I'm so excited! is eating stroganoff, waiting for her hubby to come home and then maybe some sleep. 6 more days.... I'm counting down! The siren in Reedsburg keeps going off. It's not the normal noonblast siren, it sounds like an air-raid siren and continued for 10 minutes. Can anyone tell me how to find out what the damn things mean? SLEEP>WAKE UP>EAT>MORE WALLS AND FLOORS! wishes vampire wars didn't take so long to put monies and energy back to your character.

Tommorrow, I turn 21. I'm super excited. And I can't wait for 4 pm to roll around..... Mercer, here I come! It never fails...

They got me.... those darn Zynga games..... so addicting..... 3//3//10 *PROPNAME* is coming! i need a massage. Now. Any takers?

I'm just tired. finally found out who got her hubby and kid sick... and is pissed that she didn't find out until her son started puking. has discovered that is an AWFUL idea to sleep on her back.

I have no idea what's going on! wants her stupid sore throat to go away already! excited about volunteering tomorrow! and hopeful about my job interview this cold ain't gonna keep me from line dancin my boots off tonight! YeeHaa! ""If we were never ill, we would not know what it was to be well. If we never knew hunger, we would take no pleasure in being full. If there were never any war, we would not appreciate peace. And if there were no winter, we could never see the spring."" is sick and wishes her mom was here to make her some tea and chicken soup... , for the first time since she first arrived on facebook years ago, started to fill out the ""personal information"" section on her profile. the times, they are a-changin... money should never be the goal, only the byproduct. is beyond pissed at *PROPNAME* right now... is eating top ramen for the first time in a LONG time... really wants to chop all her hair off... well, not all of it, just a lot of it... is super excited to see *PROPNAME* today!!! *PROPNAME* was AAAWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE!!!!!!! I would go see his show live over watching it on TV any day! is boycotting NBC the night wasn't a waste afterall :) going Salsa dancing tonight... hope I don't embarrass myself  :) doesn't like thunder :( sometimes wonders (as much as I LOVE *PROPNAME*) if the whole NBC vs. *PROPNAME* fiasco is actually a ploy to boost ratings and get better guests for the tonight show... because, if so, it's working... just got home after not having been since 4:30 to find a candle still lit on my dresser... oops... �The God I believe in is with those who suffer, doesn�t punish those or create evil for those who are already suffering� started the day off right: with a big fat ticket from the #%$&*!@ Los Angeles police department... finally watched the final episode of The Tonight Show with *PROPNAME*. It was amazing, and *PROPNAME*'s speech brought me to tears. I also loved hearing that he and I have something in common; cynicism is my least favorite quality, too� I�ll miss you *PROPNAME*! It's a concept that represents a profound shift from how we think about money and satisfaction and the obligation of a government to its people. finished her taxes  :D needs to go to sleep now! going rock climbing in the morning (eek!) desperately needs a job... take a nap or go to the gym... what to do what to do... two fire trucks just pulled up to the apartment building across the street. I'm assuming//hoping it's not an extremely urgent matter because the firemen weren't exactly running into the building, more like moseying... had a wonderful night! hung out with some really great people and listened to some really great music! ""If it's true, if I am indeed addicted to sadness, I absolve myself of blame. Responsibility rests firmly with my brain. It is a flawed design. Worse than the 1975 Ford Pinto and just as dangerous."" wishes she was a football fan... from urbandictionary: ""She has the most beautiful eyes and hair.  She smells that of a fall evening, and her voice will typically seranade you."" and ""A really sexy, funny, smart girl that every guy wants. 'Damn, you lucky bastard, your gf is a total *PROPNAME*!'""  :D might need to start figuring out what organs she can sell on the black market... anyone know if and where the state of the union address might be viewable online? I've googled it but can't find anything, and I don't have tv so I didn't get to watch it live :( new goal for 2010: write something for publication and actually have it published. Yay blue skies! just interviewed at an organization whose office is in the same building and on the same floor as the Production, Art, and Writing offices for Mad Men. Pretty cool :) ""...the event marked a major shift, what I might call a 'paradigm shift' if I were the kind of person who used terms like 'paradigm shift'..."" is glad hulu has the entire Strangers with Candy series... funny stuff going to an underground art show tonight complete with art (of course), live music, drinks, body painting, and free pancakes :D  It's going to be quite an eclectic experience!"

79,y,y,y,n,y,"Best. Wedding. Ever. I LOVE YOU TO DEATH EM AND COL! Who's gonna see the Harry Potter movie with me? The person who comes is still allowed to judge me. is sick =( 34,865 Kleenex and some codeine later, Kea rejoins the world of the living... took the first step toward developing a green thumb today. Windowbox basil, anyone? Good god, vacation can't get here soon enough. Here I come sun, sand, fresh seafood, and pleasure reading! Well, it finally happened: I bought a coffee so big it didn't fit in my microwave for re-heating. (Sub-status update: Go to bing.com for some major Boston pride ;-) Enjoying the lovely golden weekend! couldn't hate these new Gap commercials more. They are seriously the devil's handiwork. s dream of a roof garden will not be dashed, gosh darn it! is pretty inspired by how active (and cool) some of her geriatrics patients are... So like, what's the deal with *PROPNAME*? I think I'm missing a basic understanding of this cultural phenomenon. Did anyone else think it was obvious *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME* were getting a divorce like 34 seasons ago? Life is so good! Medicine rocks and I am so proud of my man for his stellar performance review today. Here comes the first Latino Microsoft CEO, watch and wait. The roof garden is born! Will post pics after a dinner made with our very own herbs =) hates saying bye to *PROPNAME*=( Apparently, all it takes for me to go on a semi-psychotic, cockroach-killing rampage is two glasses of wine and a strategically placed Dansko. Ok, the new *PROPNAME* & *PROPNAME* is kind of amazing. NOW who is coming with me on 10//22? Very slowly meandering my way toward garden bliss. Does anyone in Philly have a patio umbrella they're trying to rid themselves of, by chance? Days becoming so much shorter... Hooked on Weeds without any way of getting my next dose soon. Damn you, Netflix instant queue and your empty promises. If this societal obsession with vampires had happened while I was going through my ""phase"" in middle school, it really could have changed my life. Good luck on shelves tomorrow, friends! Out into the cool fall air for lots of mocha and a little studying. never appreciated how good a dancer *PROPNAME* was until the recent marathons of Dirty Dancing. Kudos where kudos are due. Anyone interested in joining me for *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME* on Oct. 22 at the Electric Factory? Ticket are $35 =( but I'd go with good company! s mind was just completely blown by the awesomeness of Zahav (Israeli restaurant here). Easily in the top three restaurants I've eaten at, worldwide. Go there. Now. Enjoying the nostalgia of fall... Hi, fall. How about getting to bed early? Anyone want to jump on the bandwagon? Forty-five minutes on a Rittenhouse bench, with a bag full of veggies and La Colombe mocha, really turns the day around =) just had chicken McNuggets for dinner. This is a new low. And it's called ""short call at CHOP."" Just burned out. Q3 overnight call at CHOP tomorrow. Poopie. forgot how much she missed House until she saw the premiere. Love it. thinks it feels pretty fly to see her tiny shoots of arugula (and spinach, kale, and two types of lettuces) battling the odds! Hm. Apparently running for the first time in months makes me simultaneously feel like horse $#!@ and want to devour a steak. Wasn't prepared for that. How did fall completely slip through the crack between summer and winter? Maybe I should have Bing'd whether staph aureus toxin is inactivated via boiling BEFORE boiling and eating the soup I left out for 24 hours. *PROPNAME* at RitFit is my new favorite person. It's kinda nice to be cajoled into thinking you're ""way stronger than you think"" at doing bicep curls. And that's what I'm paying him for. Just scared myself senseless by watching most of Dracula. I am such a bigger pansy than I used to be, back in my vampire-obsessed, middle-school days... Sick day today =( Weekends go by so quickly... =( No wonder *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* *PROPNAME* dumped *PROPNAME*. His song about her is HORRENDOUS, even for a 90s ballad. Now I understand that *PROPNAME* is a (marginal) step up for her. *Shudder* had about 7L of insensible losses via mouth-breathing last night and woke up with a tongue the consistency of beef jerky. This viral URI can stick it up its tiny viral you-know-whoosy. Holy crap. I am in love with you *PROPNAME* y *PROPNAME*. IN LOVE WITH YOU. Turned the heat on, finally. can't taste her food and is officially pissed at her URI. Somtimes you just gotta laugh. finally drove out the dust ponies. They were becoming too domesticated and needed to be set free in their natural habitat. needs free and lazy costume ideas. The polls are open! has 10 times more respect for *PROPNAME* after her crazy bra lady moves. Herioc indeed. watched in shock today as a nurse on the bus poked and yelled at an old, disabled man for sitting too close to her in the section designated for old and disabled people. Wishing I'd said something. Buy a Christmas//Hannukah//Kwanzaa//Solstice tree? Check. Get Step 1 books? Check. Start dinner before 10pm? Check. It's really amazing what we can accomplish when we're let out of surgery early! Sunday blues. I recounted my nap-dream to Raf just now. He recounted that he wanted to shoot himself in the face. Apparently the narrative was much more exciting and dramatic in my head... Note to self: Trying to rekindle an old flame for string cheese is not well accomplished using low-salt, skim mozarella sticks. Not only is Dracula good, but Batman Forever is still amazing. I had SUCH good taste in movies as a high schooler, holy crap! And now I like The Holiday?! Christmas tree decorating. *PROPNAME* of the Bells. Potentially cocoa and//or holiday cookie baking. I am officially the worst Jew ever. Is anyone else kinda suffering through this elective ranking process? I spent months obsessing over the exciting possibilities, and now all I want to do is avoid it... Halfway done with med school and off to the Outer Banks for two weeks. Limited access to phone and e-mail, but will check when I can! CONGRATS classmates! *PROPNAME* has officially caused my imminent failing of OB//GYN. I have spent a cumulative day reading ""The Hunger Games"" and its sequel, ""Catching Fire"" in the last week. And now I can't study because I'm pining for the final book in the series, which won't come out til August. Damn you, *PROPNAME*, and your cruel attempt to get me reading again! Brokeback is officially the most depressing movie of all time. Thank you, Case Files. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to expect when undergoing ""The Menopause."" Home sweet turkey! Sunday. *PROPNAME* gone. And the person standing in line behind me at the minimart, who saw me paying with a bill that had a giant inappropriate anatomical figure on it, was a pastor. Of course. Me: ""Omg I am tired after two robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomies with bilateral salpingoopherectomies. *PROPNAME*: ""Awesome I did a fatakanicous dilopidous internal rectomy today too."" I pity the fool who is forced to date a med student. T-6 days til St. John and leaving *PROPNAME* til March. I just realized how weird this feels. Mmm. Nothing like tea and Galetti to transport me back to early morning breakfasts in Florence. ""Cuz when the roof caved in and the truth came out I just didn't know what to doooo, But when I become a star we'll be living so large I'll do anything for youuuu..."". On repeat. I don't care if this makes me a loser. got a white Christmas of her own: hilltop house engulfed in a cloud all day! Thx for pulling through, St. John ;-) Santa must LOVE me; St. John bound in T-11 days! If there had been a real fire tonight, everyone in my building (including me) would be burned to a crisp right now because apparently a fire alarm isn't enough to lure us from our dens. wishes the weekend would never end =) Waiting for a batch of homemade peppermint bark to set in the fridge to help ring in the New Year! Suck it, Williams Sonoma, with your exorbitant prices! wouldn't mind if a Philly, NYC, or Boston friend posted pics of the snowy city to FB! C'mon, give a girl a white Christmas =) Kea: For the love of God, I am begging you to return those heinous Brooks Brothers shirts. *PROPNAME*: Well your face is heinous. And I don't ask you to return THAT. (Just another morning's playful banter between someone studying for Step 1 and someone fighting off an awful cold...) Finally caved and saw Avatar. As I suspected, real life now looks bland and 2-D. =// just canceled out the vote of an obnoxious, be-cashmere-scarved prettyman chanting ""*PROPNAME*, hare krishna, *PROPNAME*"" in the middle of Starbucks. Health care for all! Here's hoping the House and Senate can reach some sort of agreement... Almost just passed out in the library trying to test my Valsalva//baroreceptor//HR reflex. And no, my reflex is NOT intact, thankyouforasking. Frick! is officially more than halfway done studying for Step 1. Yikos. just completed her night cheese ;-) would rather be potting. Even after 10 hours in the studio this weekend... s library nemesis has answered her pine nut brittle with chips, a paper lunch bag, and a thinly-veiled apology for his ""snack attack."" Touch�, library nemesis, touch�. just found a blue rubber band in her pork wonton. Really, USMLE World? You really want me to know which growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and which ones need JAK//STAT for signal transduction? I poop on you. I hate to disappoint you, but my rubber lips are immune to your charms. 1. Kea: a) one who has an excessive amount of cool b) a verb showing that someone is doing something sick c) a person filled with self-loathing for actually following this FB fad Meh. Ok, *PROPNAME*. You only get to name ONE disease with a name that ridiculous. Come on! can't decide if it's good or bad that med students score worse than a monkey randomly choosing an answer for some of these USMLE questions... just typed ""loves 30 Rock so much it hurts sometimes"" into the FB search box. I think I'm hemorrhaging brain cells at this point. Had a dream last night that I defied the laws of the space-time continuum. Isn't that like the holy grail of dreams? Who dat?! Seriously going insane. Actually wishing I could move up my date to spare myself the psychological nightmare of last-minute USMLE studying. thinks one of her library nemeses is trying her own emergency tactic on her, namely, faking a horrendous cough to drive others away. Oh, it's ON, bitch! caved."

Probably going to play again today... Now that I'm out, planning to come to *PROPNAME*'s wedding read *PROPNAME*'s ""Check Raising the Devil"" in one sitting and enjoyed it.  An honest look into his life, and glimpse into the sometimes fun and sometimes dark side of vegas & gambling.  Also watching ""The Universe"" DVD set still... it's amazing.  If you lik has left the country.  Enough poker at the WSOP, time to travel around a bit! is back in vegas, ready to win the main event! ... not really b//c i'm never going to win a tournament.  hopefully I can take down a few $$$ anyways =) has started doing Hot Yoga, and really enjoys it.  I think I'll make it a habit! back from vid's wedding.. it was a blast!  Congratulations to them both.  I am ready for some more high stakes gambling in Las Vegas.  One time! is leaving Manila in a few hours for Nice, France... is a little sick of poker... been playing Fallout 3 a lot last few days instead of poker all day... =) is chillin in Boracay at the Shangri-La.  This place is beautiful!  I just got out of farm country in the Philippines, and got massacred by mosquitoes.  Need a few days of sun and relaxation to recover.  =) is playing the FTOPS main event in his hotel in Nice... trying to stay patient tho i'm tired from a day of travelling and just want to sleep.  Tomorrow I go for a week on a yacht... more R&R + fun people + a whole lotta gambling... sounds like a slice of heaven. is posting this from 30,000 feet above the surface of the earth, somewhere over nebraska in an airplane.  Wow, what an amazing world we live in! wow... so many cool stories... boats r fun I'm now in Cannes for the tournament coming up in a couple days.  ... getting a little homesick, been gone almost 2 months did full-fledged bikram for the first time (a 90-minute class as opposed to the 60 minute classes i had already done)... and it was hard!

Just gonna add that to my ToDo List here... get around to that at some point... (wow im hopeless) has a big bet on the WSOP final table... I bet on *PROPNAME* to win vs *PROPNAME* to win against *PROPNAME*.  Any other winners is a tie. I figure *PROPNAME* is about 3:1 & *PROPNAME* is about 7.5:1 I loooove my bet right now (no odds!)  I wanted to book more action last night vs *PROPNAME* when I saw him at the Bellagio, but he doesn't like his side anymore.  Ship the EV kidd!!!!! feels like doing things is hard. wow - i just played COD4MW2 all night with 3 buddies... I felt like I was back in college thanks to my mom for an amazing feast... I just crashed out afterwards and caught up on 15 hours of sleep.  Now I'm up early in Poway and ready to go!  Who's out there??? 15k at bellagio today... off to the races just went paintballing in SD... always a great time!  The bruises go away after a few days, but the memories of capping your friends last a lifetime. Thanks to the beauty of anythingyouwantdelivery.com ... I have CallOfDuty4MW2 on the way right to my place right now, for just a small delivery charge (along with some Chipotle)... I've been hearing amazing things about it (best fps since Counterstrike)... and I might have to do a little gaming what a night last night... my liver took one for the team is on a mission in the gym.  My body is changing daily, and I feel and think better then I have in a while.  Exercise: the only healthy drug! is currently reading Fooled by Randomness... Today I put my book down in the midst of a reverie at my airplane window and felt as if my brain were a  bad sieve, realizing that I was bound to forget most of the wonderful things I was reading... If only I could remember everything useful that I've learned and forgotten. does not know anything about the destruction of any RVs outside of Las Vegas in the desert. current favorite song: Chainside - I Would Die For You (Club Mix) back in San Diego for xmas is a relatively short stack going in to day 3 of the Bellagio 15k tourney... about to leave to go play now. finished Fooled by Randomness... it's an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone.  I'm now 80 pages into Chaos by *PROPNAME* and am enjoying it.  Go reading! thinks Backgammon is fun!! is up a little too early in the morning (9:30AM)... and doesn't know what to do with himself.  I think I'm going to get some quality reading time with Chaos (*PROPNAME*)... btw there is a scale for the quality of your reading (how focused//distracted//tired, etc...), and right now i think my reading will be pretty solid is stoked bc a big grocery store, a nice gym, and a pinkberry (best after workout carbs ever..) are all within 1 block of my penthouse in Ipanema.  Not to mention the beach is a few blocks away.  I am about to go to all those places and then the beach... I'm in heaven What a beautiful life... my family, my friends... amazing. If I could have one ""genie in the bottle"" wish, not including any kind of life extension, I think I would take perfect knowledge.  i.e., complete knowledge of everything already known and possibly knowable to the human mind (excluding future events) taking care of last minute business... because tomorrow I'm going to Brazil =) missed my connecting flight from atlanta to rio last night, i now have to spend 24 hours in atlanta to catch the same flight later today.  it's under freezing here, and i have no long-sleeve tops and a single pair of jeans.  Hello hotel room!  Time for movies!  I think I might be coming down with a cold too... wow, I hope it's a quick one that just goes away. is finally in Brazil after 2 whole days of travelling just rolled out of bed, not sure what the plan for the day is yet.  but who really cares?  i'm just happy to be going along for the ride wow I enjoy watching good movies... just watched ""House of Sand & Fog"", an older movie... excellent.  Emotionally very powerful. And Avatar in 3d on IMAX like a week ago, also excellent but for many different reasons. It is fine with me for a movie to excite your imagination instead of your emotions. back in Vegas... time to make Victory Poker a reality I think I just spent about 45 hours in the last week playing a video game.  Mass Effect 2 was awesome, but I am glad to have my life back.  Still hitting the gym hard. wow, I got d-r-u-n-k last night... hangover in full effect.  mike gets in today, and I think we are all going to the lake.  I might actually get a little sun... don't worry I'll have sunscreen =) wow... mass effect 2 just arrived.  //life"

I also have Singstar mics and a memory card, now I all I need are some suggestions for games a beginner can play..? I quite like Crash and Spyro... I had my hair dyed and straightened on Thursday.

Musta been, I dunno, sleep-spelunking or somethin last night-cos I woke up with a fucked up knee. I'ma try to rest this wkend & rid myself of the Mysterious Plague of Atlanta that drained me all week; wish there was a cure for excessive nihilism, though. *makes face* Ok...there are piles of ""junk that isn't supposed to be on my desk"" that keep getting bigger...while the things that are supposed to live on my desk are magically disappearing.

It was kind of sad...I apologized to Car (yeah, that's its name dammit, shut up) for smushing it, and hugged it goodbye, and then took the title to my mechanic so it can be junked.  Thusly, the day started in kind of a somber mood.  If only I could locate a sufficient replacement, though... Well, going to bed with a smile on my face.  Nice change from the rest of the week! Haha...somehow my facebook got switched to German for awhile...it was ok, 'cause I could read most of the German--just rather random!  This box asked me ""Was machts du gerade"" for half the night...lol.  Actually I might switch it back to German and leave it for awhile--it amuses me! :P Soooo frickin' psyched for Atlanta.

""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche Bah! Humbug! In other news, I really wanna see Ninja Assassin! In other news...eh, don't matter anyway, nevermind. Car Search 2009=driving me mad! No jetpacks on ebay (I checked) so that's out. Rollerblading'd surely break my ass. Motorcycle=me smeared across the pavement. Mopeds are...small. No horse handy or I could Amish it up w// a little cart! Bikeseats hurt my delicate posterior. Boats don't travel well on land. Don't think Segways go fast enough to get anywhere-I'd probably fall off anyway. Hurry up & invent transporters!! Having a mixed day: got less than 1 hour of sleep (and even that was interrupted sleep!), so I'm kinda white-knuckling it through the workday a bit...but also got the car 'legal' at the DMV--and it only took like 30 minutes!  Well, at least I'm too tired to think myself into a funk again! I just saw an...interesting...car commercial. According to said commercial, apparently ""Twilight's *PROPNAME*"" drives...a Volvo. A Volvo. A vampire...in a Volvo.* Wow...I didn't think that that character could get any lamer; I was wrong!  *No offense to Volvo owners, the cars are fine...but 'Mister (supposedly) SuperAwesome Vampire' driving one? LOL. is now friends with I NEED A FUCKING CAR!!! I gotta ask: why pirates OR ninjas?  Why not both?  Also, two interesting concepts I've recently discovered: Horror Cakes competition on Food Network tomorrow (one of them bleeds when you cut the cake! AWESOME!)...and a children's book series I saw in the bookstore recently, called Vampirates...I dig the name, and the concept...not sure about the execution though.  Still...intriguing! Feeling quite content, in spite of all that 'ails' me. *quirks lips into a serene smile* ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torment of man.""--Friedrich Nietzsche ---------------------------------------- Yeah, fuck hope.  Let's try action!  Control what you CAN control.  Determination burns within me again. Tired of introspection tonight; it leaves me...bereft...and the silence screams madly in my ears. Finally got a car! 1998 Nissan Altima GXE w// 98,700 miles on it in pretty good shape. Mechanics aside, glad I have a car w// a stereo again. Don't like that it's white, but I took what I could get! Might either mural-paint or shop-repaint it if it annoys me enough.  Also had a really great weekend (Thank you, guys. Xoxo!)--nice change from the last few! Glad as hell I'm not stranded anymore!! is FREEZING!  Not feeling very good, either.  Hope it's a 'passing fancy' and not an Ailment! Happy Halloween all! Stuck @ home recuperating from totaling my fuckin car yestermorn-they're right, it DOES hurt more the day after-but ""I'M NOT DEAD YET!!"" Great time last night tho-celebrating LIVING. Thanx to all who made it possible & who made it awesome! Yay Dethklok show, Asylum, & some fucking wonderful humans, including my rockin' friends & lotsa cool folks I met last night. *hugs the world, retreats to bed* I'm back from Atlanta, over 24 hours after I was s'posed to be...am worn the fuck out.  But had a great fuckin' time down there before the airtravel assraping!  So, yay to that! ;D URGENT!!  Does anyone want to see SONIC YOUTH with DINOSAUR JR. TONIGHT at Terminal 5 in Manhattan (show starts 8 PM)??  Sean is sick and can't go so I have a FREE TICKET to the show, which is SOLD OUT otherwise.  If you're interested, drop me a text!! 631-714-9319. Sweet respite... *snooze* Waking from a really good dream into harsh reality is one of the great cruelties of life.  *groggy and disgruntled* ...and now back to my regularly scheduled severe dangerously-nihilistic depression. :D!!!1!1!!!1!!!!one! Bored with cartoons & porn...time to sleep I guess. *blink, shrug, yawn* It just occurred to me that two of my favorite songs are punk songs about gruesome abortions (""Bodies"" by Sex Pistols and ""Die of Shame"" by Tilt)...man, I'm just not quite right, lol! ""Just another manic Monday""...nah, not really--if I was manic right now I'd probably be getting alot more done, lol! Intelligence is a curse, life a senseless disease.  Gods grant me respite by death or lobotomy... My, how the randomness abounds!...but I need some sleep. Heh...:""God I wish that I could hide away//And find a wall to bang my brains//I'm living in a fantasy,//a nightmare dream...reality//People ride about all day//In metal boxes made away//I wish that they would drop the bomb//And kill these cunts//that don't belong!

Holy shit, the sky is falling: my dad actually CHEERED ME UP out of a tough spot for once!  Maybe he's learning!  Or maybe it was a fluke...either way, I feel a lot better now!  :)  Dammit someone find me a good yoga studio now, lol! Meh. Bleh. Feh!! My body may be a medical nightmare, but at least it leaves me hangover-free for some reason, hah!  Glad to see everyone last night...thanks all for the *loves* and for those who were kind in the face of my drunken overhonesty, oy. Never enough needs a change. Anyone know any yoga studios in or close to the Smithtown//Kings Park area? Gotta find my zen again! Sunday bloody Sunday...booooring...! Just had a 20-minute conversation w// my dad about midget porn.  Sometimes he ain't half bad, lol... It's amazing what you'll watch on TV when you stay up all night. ""Yes yes yes, effervescently meaningless..."" Getting another potential car checked out by my mechanic tomorrow...god I hope one of these fucking things works out soon! *blows up apartment* What's black and green and red all over?  Me after the GWAR show, YEAH! XD  Time for the sleep of a lifetime now, though...damn. Getting out of the house, yay!  Going with 'Anon' (lol) to eat curry and hang out with folks or someodd.  Man, anywhere's better than being stuck at my stupid apartment! Sick of this nihilistic depression shit--fine, life may be meaningless, I may be right about all the other disturbingly bleak shit I've been thinking...but I'm not a self-killer so I'm stuck here--might as well pull it together and live this crazy life I've got anyway, eh?  Some change is in the works (just in time for the New Year, ironically). Yes, I have no bananas...I have no bananas todayyyyy! Going upstairs to beg my dad for some of the wonderful-smelling eggplant parm they just made! *crosses fingers* No food down here. :( Me da is my hero right now...he found me some fucking NYQUIL!!  25 hours awake is waaaay more than enough (especially when I'm sick).  Going to go smoke with the ghost in the back of my head (heyy, random little-remembered song reference!).  GOODNIGHT FOLKS!! Went to the latest Disney cartoon with my dad tonight...it was set in New Orleans and it was surprisingly pretty good. But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech. Trying everything I can to get rid of it quickly! I gotta admit...Powerpuff Girls cracks me up! :P  Yeah, shush. In other news...FUCK I'm freezin' me arse off! If I'm stuck in the house long enough, maybe I'll clean it!  That's looking on the bright side I guess...at least I'm in a better mood and a little less ill than yesterday, though maybe a little stir crazy--I found myself dancing to the Baskin *PROPNAME* 'ice cream and cake' commercial, lol! Ugh...headache and some amount of nervousness.  Resurrection tomorrow night though, yay!  Night all... Holy sinus headache, Batman! *left eyeball, unable to take the 'pressure,' explodes out of skull, shoots across room, lands in file drawer under ""O"" for ""Owwww""* Tis the season to cough up weird stuff...yecch. Can't sleep--landmines in my mind.  Awake since 6 AM, ugh... Happy thingy, people... Ok...broken snow shovel, and the plow bastard we called is 2 hours late.  Don't mind too much that I'm missing work, but I DO mind that I have no food in the house and wanted to go BUY SOME FUCKING FOOD!  That plow motherfucker will be getting my SPACEBOOT up his PLOWTASTIC ASS!  As long as I don't pass out from starvation first, hmph. Had bad dreams last night, some sobering thoughts on my mind...yet I'm still in a good mood today.  I don't get it, but I'm not complaining! Sad & depressed as hell, but ROCKING the LIVING FUCK out...weird combination. Supposedly Hauppauge means ""land of sweet water.""  Somehow I doubt the water's very ""sweet"" anymore, considering that Hauppauge is now an industrial district... Dear Santa:  I know I'm a Grinch, but could you please bring me a computer repairman for Christmas?  I'll make you jambalaya... ""And life is thorny, and youth is vain; And to be wroth with ones we love doth work like madness in the brain.""--Samuel Taylor Coleridge My car no longer screeches like a banshee passing kidney stones...thanks, Mr. Mechanic!  In other news, my 'simple' cold is worsening by the hour and I'm feverish...and all of the home remedies and cold meds I try are for naught!  Bah! Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch. He says the Wizard is a prick, by the way.  And, ""Look! Look, Bev, they dropped a fuckin' house on her!!"" Sorry I had to bail so early on Sanctuary last night, folks...sick & tired does not a fun Bev make--sittin' in the corner like ol' granny watchin' the kiddies play outside! *scrunches nose* I'm so pleased today I might start glowing! XD ...Hopefully more in a pleasant way than a radioactive way.  A new year is directly impending, YAY!!  Ecstatic for a symbolic fresh start// season of change, let me tell you! Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly! Second half of last week quite sucked and was uneventful to boot...may this week be an improvement!  *kicks suckiness repeatedly with pointy!pointy!shoes* Dammit dammit I can't SLEEP!  Awake all night then tried to fall asleep for 4 hours.  At least if I had hypothermia I'd fall unconscious...hmm.  But that would require going outside...or, more importantly, moving.  Fuck that noise! Hoping this insane wind doesn't blow me away to Oz...those Munchkins might've gone feral by now. *shudder* I lahk the cut o' yerr jib...*licks teeth creepily* Well...if my interactions and happenings of last night were any indication, 2010 may well be a pretty good year...but we'll see!  Happy new year, love y'all! :D is currently being a disgruntled employee...grrr. *brandishes fist ineffectually* Eh, why the hell not:  THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING. Lets see how honest my FB friends are. Leave a 1 word comment that you think best describes ME. It can only be 1 word. No more than 1 word. Then copy & paste this post on your wall so I can leave a word about you. Wonder how many brave friends will do this. Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored! 2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...) Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much. My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb. Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah! *sneeze, cough, snort* Blech!  Trying that Airborne shit TONIGHT!  At least I'm getting the screechy car fixed today.  Now if I could only find gloves that match eachother...*wearing one black leather glove and one knit blue striped glove* ""Is it special when you're lonely// do you spend your whole life// in a studio apartment// with a cat for a wife// The seasons, when they call you// do you barricade the door// are you stubborn, stubborn, stubborn to the core?...Then the longest winter// is on her way// you called her without knowing it// but now it's too late..."" Trying to keep the zen, but it's hard to hang onto sometimes on nights like these. Cold weather can bite me, and so can Christmas.  *sticks out tongue*  I'm doin' reasonably alright today but ehhhhh...got a 'eadache from 'ell. *sigh* OI!!! Feeling DAMN GOOD headwise lately: forceful self-change of outlook, meds seem to be finally working, & I'm startin to get shit done! 'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy! Sick as a dog and wishing my heat worked better. Hoping for as little snow as possible, under these circumstances! hates crying, hates her health (or lack thereof), hates snow, and hates Christmas and its trappings of tomfoolery.  Today has become a day of hate. *angry pout* *Rootin' around for 'retro' Bev pics* Meow meow TIIIIIREDDDD meow meow. *pokes work with stick* Hopin' I'll sleep tonight! Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being! Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise! Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose! WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe! Have good weekend, meine leibschen, yes yes!  I kiss you, muah!  (Me, hausfrau?!  Nein, NEIN!!!) Ehh...bite me! ""Some of the shows on MTV are not my cup of tea...mainly because I don't like huge pieces of shit in my tea!"" doesn't get it--even when I get enough sleep, I run out of energy LONG before the day is over...what gives?!  This rampant exhaustion really puts a cramp on my life & times...and now I'm gonna go sleep some more.  Hmph! *sigh* I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated. Sleepytime at last!  Bundled up in blankets like fuckin' Jesus inna manger.  Or medieval couples that weren't sposed to fuck yet, lol.  Fuck off, snow! So very frustrated...& kinda sad. And so fucking sleepy...god DAMN these meds, I'm sleeping my life away. MEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHURRRRRGHHHHHHHH..... is ok now. Why do I insist on eating popsicles in winter?  OM NOM NOM The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe... It liiiives!!!  (Meds adjusted--we'll see if I stay awake today! *blinkblink*) *shrug* Eh. is trying not to be grumpy. Ok lady I love you buh-bye! *finally leaves house* Off to prepare for a night of festivitation...2010 here we come, haharr! Getting ready for ma belle *PROPNAME*'s birthday whatnottery...may I not fall asleep face-down in cake this evening!*crosses fingers* Hangin' with *PROPNAME*...stay awake, stay awake! *pokes self with fork* Dear car battery: Why are you dead again?  What am I going to do with you?? (No, really--what am I supposed to do with it?)  You make me sad. :// Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?! Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D Taken off the troublesome med! Back to Bev as usual now I guess. BRRR!  ""Stiff Little Fingers"" indeed! doesn't know what to think. Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles* just remembered a TV ad from her childhood in the 'glorious' south: horribly fat, hideous ANGELS with big ol' hair, Tammy-Faye-esque makeup, and (of course) heavy southern accents hollering ""DON'T YOU BUY NO UUG-LY TRUUCK!"" Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA! Meow? Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from. Oddly enough, my skin was better when I was a teenager than it is now! Black. Well, meds situation is not ideal by any means (zombieish again) but it's a vast improvement on the last few days of horror! I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like! I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.) has been too busy living life to spend much time on facebook this week--just the way I like it! :D Whew. Got to be 'early to rise' tomorrow, so I'ma try to be 'early to bed' tonight...thusly, going to bed now; we'll see how that goes! is amused at the universe today. *cracks up* Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me! Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning."

A kid in my class put a frog down another kids shirt today, along with the branches the frog was in.  After the frog, leaves and branches fell out of his shirt, the boys spent 5 minutes trying to catch the frog, while I (the teacher) stood in the corner with the screaming girls afraid of the frog. Then the frog peed on the boy who caught it. Thank God it's a short school week! had to laugh when the doctor was cutting off her Thai good luck bracelets in order to put on a cast. Lame Canada! Sorry neighbors to the north, but after China�s opening Olympic ceremony 2 years ago, that was just weak. Even *PROPNAME* can�t show up 10,000 in sync drumming Chinamen.

He looked a little confused and tried to push them back, so I posted them back out again. Ahh its fun to piss off people. Feeling like crap, no temperature though so at least its not swine flu (at least I think its not!) Got a pair of degu's last night, already causing issues! They are uber cute though.

This isn't funny drunk *PROPNAME*. is glad that it's summertime, and the living is easy. One of these mornings, she'll rise up singing. just got home from spending 11 glorious hours with her family. It was an awesome day. Sorry for all the missed calls and texts, my phone died many hours ago. I'm leavin' on a cruise ship, but I do know when I'll be back again. Seriously though, no phone or internet all week, so I will be incommunicado. You kids have fun, try not to do anything too crazy. is home again! The Caribbean was amazing! had good talkings tonight. Fun times were had by all. One more double before nine days of freedom. can't stop here! This is bat country! You win some, you lose some. Week 2 doesn't say anything about the Playoffs. There's always next week. And lets be fair, the competition next week is the Chiefs. Ahahaha. ought to be cast in the next big zombie movie as an extra. Because she feels like the living dead must feel after a night of heavy brain-eating. Is that their equivalent of drinking? Explains why they want to do it all the time. needs to be herself, she can't be no one else. She's feeling supersonic, give her gin and tonic. She could have it all, but how much does she want it? Damn, those Eagles looked sharp today. Too bad the Red Sox couldn't do the same. Made some cash last night playing poker. Hopefully a repeat performance tonight? hasn't felt the way she feels today in so long it's hard for her to specify. has got no time to for spreadin roots, the time has come to be gone. And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on. is at a weird place in her life right now. A road map would be handy. has the damn flu. Could the universe's timing have been any worse? She thinks not. Woot, go Chiefs. :D would love to have something that even remotely resembles a reasonable sleep schedule. feels severely under-appreciated. It's lame. has had a very good day, and looks to have a good night also. doesn't look different, but she has changed. You're looking through her, she's not the same. wants to live where soul meets body, and let the sun wrap its arms around her, and bathe her skin in water cool and cleansing, and feel, feel what it's like to be new. has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer. proved her epic ninja skills tonight. shall live in the sunshine, swim the sea, and drink the wild air's salubrity. was hoping some of the punk kids in her apartment complex would nab the jack-o-lanterns off her balcony and give them the honor of a good smash. Instead she had to unceremoniously toss them in the dumpster. will begin tomorrow well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with her old nonsense. is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head. had one of her worst nights ever at work, after spending all day actually believing today would be a good day. will have a bit of fun, watching everyone pass her by. is sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun. (573): Fact: The drinking you do in college doesn't affect your liver in real life. wanted more than life could ever grant. She's bored with the chore of saving face. loves that she has some of the nerdiest friends ever. She's seen at least ten *PROPNAME* poems posted today.

She just wants to feel some sunshine. just thought that you would know you're a god, and she is not. took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise. doesn't want to be at the mercy of her emotions. She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them. is watching the lights go down, letting the cables sleep. Whatever you say, it's all right, whatever you do it's all good. is simultaneously packing, doing laundry, cleaning, and jamming out.  Ah, productivity. is home from work and back to packing//cleaning. January 2nd can't come soon enough, because this is starting to get really monotonous. can be painfully petty and selfish at times.

152,n,y,n,n,y,"just finished drill...8 people fell out need to do calc grilling with the battalion working on calculus military science III had to move to delta There is no squabbling so violent as that between people who accepted an idea yesterday and those who will accept the same idea tomorrow. back to class battalion level smoke session at 2130 Calc, History, comp, then chem height and weight test under bravo chem and then im done with classes for the day i hate wednesdays Adversity causes some men to break, others to break records............ ..back from the gym ms III class phone sucks i apologize for my last status no real smoke session took place...im not sure what it was no Dream as if you have forever. Live as if you only have today going to the gym Think what a better world it would be if we all, the whole world, had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap... Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail parade practice...worst time of the day He who strikes first, strikes twice. It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper anybody who wants to do stx lanes tonight report to delta barracks by 745...full battle rattle..this includes rucksack,lbv with compass and water, dummy rifle, and redlines flashlight..have assault pack in rucksack bring kevlar and pc going to the gym...hit me up later Some people walk in the rain, others just get wet Anyone who can be replaced by a machine deserves to be may have overworked my abs today...feel torn The undertaking of a new action brings new strength going for a long run hit me up later Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it. The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it if you want to be a leader try and act like one There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do. If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when? lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there. If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one! .if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin getting smoked tonight I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it. Your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience. You don't so much outrun your opponents as outlast and outsmart them, and the toughest opponent of all is the one inside your head going on a run monday..enough said Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius. I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble The average estimate themselves by what they do, the above average by what they are phones dead running the course, then to the weight room Personally, I don't think there's intelligent life on other planets. Why should other planets be any different from this one? Since the house is on fire let us warm ourselves going to the qm msc III class.. good day...goodnight got my battle rattle ready Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work. Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't. Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose! despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom If life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it. Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak If you can't convince them, confuse them first free weekend The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat. Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to ME Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing. It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius finished ruck run I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best Sometimes                            it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge                            hammer chem test Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives I'm not the greatest; I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out, I pick the round. If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listeners If the path less traveled were the easy path, then all would take it, thus making greatness simply average People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid No matter where you go, there you are There is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap just got back from rugby and the weight room, going to eat....hit me up later If                            you're in a fair fight, you didn't plan it properly Your             problem is that you think you have time Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it. It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves. I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly Surprise Me Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire. If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind, what is the significance of a clean desk? Believing requires action Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before Those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life, while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation Where am I? Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking Man imposes his own limitations, don't set any We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it. Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring. http:////www.youtube.com//watch?v=K78zNtO_EFQ&feature=PlayList&p=17708ED0C8CF48C1&index=19 the slower we move the faster we die One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives. There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it. Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable. Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don't think about them, I just do them.  The decision has already been made Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity, more audacity, always audacity, his amazing success in life, war, and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things not gonna sleep good tonight No bees, no honey; no work, no money. that was fun I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round � remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten Earlier tonight, I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding What is opportunity to the man who can't use it? Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF? The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, everyday, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be crazy enough to do. Someday There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now. All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth. All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward. stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place. Dream Great...Achieve Greatness Our business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves -- to break our own records, to outstrip our yesterday by our today. When you aim for perfection, you  discover it's a moving target. Go to urbandictionary.com, type in your first name, copy and paste this as your status, and put the first entry under your name as a comment. My alarm clock & I had a fight. It wanted me to get up, I refused. Things escalated. Now I'm awake & it�s broken. Not sure who won the fight try to learn something about everything and everything about something think..see. ..act... A failure establishes only this, that our determination to succeed was not strong enough Don't always think in a straight line We do not rise to the level of  our expectations. We fall to the level of our training"

They get to go to an invitation only Christmas party at Dave & Busters Monday morning. Unfortunately. *PROPNAME*'s daddy does not want to let him go because of all the CPS stuff. Things went better. *PROPNAME* was able to retain her composur and not break down in court. The judge referred the case to ""mediation"". We go to that Jan 29th. Lord willing and with his blessing. I claim in the name of Jesus: ""Today we get the kids back."" All Prayers are welcome. Please keep *PROPNAME*'s family in your prayers tonight and tomorrow. We have to be in court at 9am. Really pray for the oldest *PROPNAME* went to his dad's for his summer visit and had his mother, brother and sister stripped from him for six months. CPS is providing Christmas for the other two but not him.  I sure hope we succeed at stripping them of their ""immunity"" and make them pay for what they've done to this family. I stopped by and visited with *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*. Only stayed about twenty minutes. I sure will be glad when they can come back home. Well we are on hold until next Wed. Both CASA and CPS are demanding current prescription records all though they have through the last court date and did not request these until yesterday. *PROPNAME*'s theropist did not show either, but he is being supenaed for Wed. *PROPNAME* just told me Tuesday, that her cancer has progressed to stage 4. Could teenage ""Huffing"" be the result of modern day child proofing and the parent neglecting to actually teach the child, ""THAT WILL KILL YOU"". Can anyone out there tell me if Jesus was EVER anointed in OIL? He was babtized in water and anointed in the Holy Spirt which is why he is called the ""anointed one"". Can anyone tell me yes or no. If yes I need scripture reference. Thank you."

I love Mondays.... can every one grasp the sarcasm in that statement. I hope so. I don't understand why some people make it so hard for you to be nice to them. I dont understand why I'm worrying about it anyway, they sure aren't. Thanksgiving cooking! Fun or stressful, I'll decide later. ITS FRIDAY! To my veteran friends, family, and strangers alike; I would like to say Thank You. Thank you for the sacrifices you have made for my safety, my freedoms, and my country. God Bless you all. just can't get into the Monay state of mind. Who can tell me how to not be a fan of something anymore? I don't want to get sick, but I think it's happening anyway :( Can't decided if she is going to Jacksonville Saturday or not. Hooray! Home from work. What was LSU thinking? Do you remember that song ""Break Stuff"" by Limp Bizkit? Thats kind of the day I'm having. Back to work. Trying to get everything cleaned up before the New Year. If you saw my desk, you would understand why I am starting now :) MERRY CHRISTMAS! People should not encourage me to drink until 4 o'clock in the morning :( and the Bucs pull it out in Overtime! Way to go! *PROPNAME* leaves the SEC, HOORAY I have SO happy the Ravens are getting a good start today! I love playoff football. I'm getting calls back on my resume, it makes me hopefull I will find the right job :) I just can't get into the swing of things today. What sad news for the Gator nation today, the resignation of Urban Meyer. Our prayers will be with Coach Meyer and his family. Upon what basis do we judge other people? Is it ithe experiances that we ourselves have, or the belifes in which we hold? is unemployed, and thinks its a good thing :)"
197,y,n,n,n,y,"I know many people have faced this issue before, but MIT Graduate Admissions should stop denying the existence of Caltech... According to a certain oil//gas industry recruiter, 3.4 < 3.0. It's creepy how facebook suggests that a certain friend has too few friends. It's really irksome when a grad school application recognizes 'California Institute of Locksmithing' but not 'California Institute of Technology.' Contra Costa County is now recruiting prison cooks at Caltech.  I didn't know they needed prison cooks that badly.  Besides, there's probably a 3.5 GPA requirement somewhere... We consider a pure gas composed of rigid, nonattracting spherical molecules of diameter d and mass m, and the number density (number of molecules per unit volume) is taken to be n. Apparently ""California Institute of Technology"" is too long a name for MIT Graduate Admissions. The moral of Ninja Assassins: if you're ever attacked by black pajama-clad assassins, your only chance of survival is riding in a Volkswagen Eos. just realized that it's cheaper to run his car on lard in Texas ($6.22//gallon) than on diesel ($6.77//gallon) in the UK. I love how Techers are always tagged as ""The Smart One."" told the guy behind the fish counter to gut a catfish by mimicing longitudinal write slices. Fun( baiting Russian trolls) > Fun( baiting generic trolls) What's this song I'm hearing on the radio with sirens, screams and gunshots?  Oh right, it's ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town."" Good thing Caltech doesn't have a front gate; otherwise, someone would write ""Wirklichkeit Macht Frei"" on top. My family now has 1 car//person, down from 1.25 cars//person. The AeroPress is back in business.  America, fuck yeah! 9//9.  Finally done. My 2005 *PROPNAME* has a ridiculously sharp throttle response.  I wonder if it has anything to do with the unintended acceleration problems... wonders why engineers are overrepresented in terrorist organizations. Mass Effect 2: It's nice to see that the Nigerian 419 scam is still going strong in 2184, this time with Batarians trying to recover quarantined Prothean artifacts. I don't know why new car dealers in Houston insist on all-season tires on all their products.  We have snow one day every 3 years! Note to 'The Wildlife Fund': Fuck you, stop pestering me about your $500 'donation' to my nonexistent 'zoo'. Dear BioWare: Dragon Age is a wonderful and entertaining game, but epic fail on the load times.  At least make the wait entertaining.  Instead of blood tracks on a map (or awkward elevator rides), how about a 2D hack 'n slash minigame?
